# Introduction
This website is a collaboration between students from Indiana University (IUPUI) in Indianapolis, United States, and students from Haaga-Helia University in Helsinki, Finland. Our topic is Equity & Inclusion in Education, and we focused our efforts on three categories: Race/Ethnicity, Gender, and LGBTQ issues. We have reviewed these three categories across three countries: the United States, Finland, and New Zealand.
